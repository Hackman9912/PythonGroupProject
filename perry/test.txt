Help on built-in function callstats in sys:

sys.callstats = callstats()
    Return a tuple of function call statistics.
    
    A tuple is returned only if CALL_PROFILE was defined when Python was
    built.  Otherwise, this returns None.
    
    When enabled, this function returns detailed, implementation-specific
    details about the number of function calls executed. The return value
    is a 11-tuple where the entries in the tuple are counts of:
    0. all function calls
    1. calls to PyFunction_Type objects
    2. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
    3. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
       and bypass PyEval_EvalCodeEx()
    4. PyMethod calls
    5. PyMethod calls on bound methods
    6. PyType calls
    7. PyCFunction calls
    8. generator calls
    9. All other calls
    10. Number of stack pops performed by call_function()
